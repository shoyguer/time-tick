## Why Use TimeTick?
Managing time systems in games can be complex. And this plugin will provide you with:
- Customizable time units with any names and relationships
- Multiple time units tracking the same parent unit independently
- Complex timing events based on multiple conditions
- Easy-to-use methods for quick setup

This is a GDExtension plugin, built with performance in mind.
